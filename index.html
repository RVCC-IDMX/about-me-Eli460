    <h2>Embedded static Google map using iFrame</h2>

    <div>
<p>Embedding a static Google map into a website using iFrame is a straightforward process that allows you to display a map of a specific location on your website. Static maps are pre-rendered images of a map that do not require any user interaction and can be displayed without the use of any JavaScript or API. By embedding a static Google map, you can provide visitors to your website with a visual representation of your business or organization's location, making it easier for them to find you.

    To embed a static Google map using iFrame, you will first need to generate a map using the Google Maps API. Once you have generated your map, you can obtain the URL for the static image by clicking on the "Share" button in the top left-hand corner of the Google Maps window. This will generate a URL that you can use to embed the map on your website.
    
    Once you have obtained the URL for your map, you can create an iFrame element on your website and set the source attribute to the URL for your map. For example, you might create an iFrame element like this:
    
    arduino


    There are several parameters that you can use to customize the appearance of your static Google map. For example, you can adjust the zoom level to show more or less detail, change the size of the map to fit your website's layout, and add markers or labels to highlight specific locations on the map.
    
    One thing to keep in mind when embedding a static Google map using iFrame is that the map image will not be interactive. Users will not be able to zoom in or out, click on markers, or interact with the map in any way. If you need a more interactive map that allows users to explore your location in more detail, you may want to consider using the Google Maps JavaScript API instead.
    
    In summary, embedding a static Google map using iFrame is a simple and effective way to display a map of your business or organization's location on your website. By customizing the parameters of your map URL, you can create a map that fits your website's design and provides visitors with the information they need to find you. Just remember that static maps are not interactive, so if you need more advanced functionality, you may want to consider using the Google Maps JavaScript API.</p>

     <p>In this example, the URL for the static map is set as the source attribute for the iFrame element. The URL includes a number of parameters that specify the location of the map, the zoom level, and the size of the image. You will also need to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual Google Maps API key. </p>
